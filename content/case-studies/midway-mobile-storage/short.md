# Midway Mobile Storage — Short Case Study

A complete rebuild of a local storage company's digital system with elite performance optimization and proven business results.

Midway Mobile Storage needed a website that actually worked. Their old site was barebones, slow, and lacked the tools customers needed to request quotes or understand inventory. JAMARQ rebuilt their entire platform into a modern, intentional system with inventory controls, a custom quote form, streamlined admin workflow, and aggressive performance optimization that achieved a 98/100 desktop score—faster than 95% of websites globally.

**Launched November 25, 2025. First online quote received December 11, 2025—just 16 days later.**

## The Challenge

Their previous website was essentially unusable:
- No functioning forms
- No real storage unit information
- No brand consistency
- No mobile optimization (74/100 mobile score)
- Extremely slow load times (3.5+ seconds)
- No way for customers to request quotes without calling
- All inquiries required phone calls during business hours

The lack of structure made it difficult for customers to trust the business or understand what was available.

## The Solution

JAMARQ designed and built a fully custom website with clear structure, a modern design system, functional tools, and elite performance optimization.

Delivered features include:
- Clean, trustworthy visual identity and layout
- Custom unit inventory system
- Quote request form with database integration
- Job application form
- Admin tools for updating key information
- **Aggressive performance optimization (98/100 desktop, 89/100 mobile)**
- Mobile-first responsive design
- SEO foundations + deployment
- A flexible system ready for future advertising

The result is a professional platform built around clarity, control, speed, and long-term sustainability.

## The Results

**Performance:**
- Desktop: **98/100 PageSpeed score** (top 5% globally)
- Mobile: **89/100** (+20% improvement from 74)
- Load time: **0.9 seconds** on desktop (down from 3.5s)
- Zero layout shift, instant interactivity
- Faster than most Vercel-hosted sites despite being on shared GoDaddy hosting

**Business Impact:**
- **First online quote received within 16 days of launch** (December 11, 2025)
- Customers now submit quote requests 24/7 without calling
- Structured data collection improves quote follow-up process
- Inventory is easy to access and understand

**Timeline to first conversion: 16 days.** This validates the entire approach—clear design, optimized performance, and frictionless workflow all contribute to measurable business results.

A fast, functional, intentional system built to replace guesswork with clarity—and optimized to outperform 95% of websites on the internet while generating real business outcomes.
