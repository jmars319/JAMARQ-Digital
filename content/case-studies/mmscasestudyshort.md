A complete rebuild of a local storage company’s digital system.

Midway Mobile Storage needed a website that actually worked. Their old site was barebones, slow, and lacked the tools customers needed to request quotes or understand inventory. JAMARQ rebuilt their entire platform into a modern, intentional system with inventory controls, a custom quote form, and a streamlined admin workflow.

The Challenge

Their previous website was essentially unusable:
• No functioning forms
• No real storage unit information
• No brand consistency
• No mobile optimization
• No way for customers to request quotes without calling

The lack of structure made it difficult for customers to trust the business or understand what was available.

The Solution

JAMARQ designed and built a fully custom website with clear structure, a modern design system, and functional tools that matched how the owner actually operates.

Delivered features include:
• Clean, trustworthy visual identity and layout
• Custom unit inventory system
• Quote request form with email integration
• Job application form
• Admin tools for updating key information
• Mobile-first performance
• SEO foundations + deployment
• A flexible system ready for future advertising

The result is a professional platform built around clarity, control, and long-term sustainability.

The Results

• Customers now submit quote requests directly from the site
• Inventory is easy to access and understand
• Admin updates are simplified
• The brand reads as legitimate, modern, and trustworthy
• The owner now has a system that supports future growth and advertising

A fast, functional, intentional system built to replace guesswork with clarity.
