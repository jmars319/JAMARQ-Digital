# Thunder Road Bar & Grill  
Custom Website and Admin System

Thunder Road Bar & Grill required a modern website that could clearly present its menu, load quickly on mobile, and be fully controlled by the business without relying on subscription platforms.

JAMARQ rebuilt the site from the ground up, delivering a fast public-facing experience paired with a purpose-built admin panel for managing menu items and weekly specials. The system replaces a vendor-controlled template with a fully owned React and PHP platform deployed on shared hosting.

The admin interface is designed around real restaurant workflows, allowing non-technical staff to update specials in minutes while preventing common errors. Layout stability, image delivery, and mobile performance were treated as first-class concerns throughout the build.

The result is a clear, fast, maintainable system that gives the owners full control of their digital presence.

Proof of traction was immediate: the team published new specials, menu updates, and job listings within the first week of launch without outside help.

**Stack:** React, PHP, MySQL  
**Launch:** November 2025
