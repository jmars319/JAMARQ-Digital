A complete rebuild of a neighborhood bar’s digital system.

Thunder Road Bar & Grill needed a website that matched the energy and clarity of their restaurant, but their old vendor-run system was slow, restrictive, and expensive. JAMARQ rebuilt the entire platform from the ground up — a custom, fast, intentional digital system the owners fully control.

The Challenge

TRBG’s previous website was locked behind a subscription service with rigid templates, unclear menu layout, and slow load speeds. Weekly specials took too long to update, and nothing truly reflected the restaurant’s authentic identity.

The Solution

JAMARQ created a custom React website with a focused design system, mobile-first performance, and a dead-simple admin panel built around the owners’ workflow. The result is a modern, high-clarity menu experience and a reliable platform they fully own.

The Results
	•	Load time reduced from ~4–6s to <1.5s
	•	Clean, intuitive menu browsing
	•	Weekly specials updated in under 5 minutes
	•	No subscriptions, no vendor lock-in, full ownership

A fast, intentional system built to match the way TRBG actually works.
